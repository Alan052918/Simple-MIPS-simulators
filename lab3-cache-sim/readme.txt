My name is Junda Ai (ja4426). This project is a collaborative project with Yujie Yu (yy3913).
The code contribution distribution is non-binary, as we discussed and altered implementation details various times over a couple of iterations.

- To compile source code: run `make` command at the project directory, this will output a `cachesimulator` executable file.
- To clean up generated files: run `make clean` command at the project directory, this will remove the executable file.
